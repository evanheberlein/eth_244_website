I am a master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC - Santa Barbara studying Water Resources Management, Coastal & Marine Resources Management, and Environmental Data Science. My academic interests include hydrology, coastal geomorphology, remote sensing, and environmental justice. I have a bachelor's degree in Biology & Environmental Studies from Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA. In my free time I enjoy cooking, reading, listening to music, and spending time in nature.
